          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> There are three ways to style a page uinsg CSS:
              <ul>
                <li> Inline CSS: Inline CSS is used for applying attributes to a specific tag. Good for use when needing a quick and permanent change. </li>
                <li> Internal CSS: Styles an element in the head. That element will then be styled the same throughout the page.</li>
                <li> External CSS: The most common way to style a webpage. It is kept in a separate file which makes design changes easier.</li>
              </ul>
            <li> CSS starts with a what you’re wanting to style, called a selector. It is followed by the declaration statements in the declaration block. A declaration is made up of the property, such as color or size, and then the value, such as blue.</li>
            <li>DRY principle: DRY stands for “Do Not Repeat Yourself”. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, one can use commas to assign code to multiple elements.</li>
            <li>(More will be added once I can figure out how to show example code)</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
              <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
