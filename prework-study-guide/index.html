            <li>To make titles use the tag h plus a number 1-6, the larger the number the smaller the title</li>
            <li>p is used to make a paragraph block</li>
            <li>ul makes an unordered list</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> There are three ways to style a page uinsg CSS:
              <ul>
                <li> Inline CSS: Inline CSS is used for applying attributes to a specific tag. Good for use when needing a quick and permanent change. </li>
                <li> Internal CSS: Styles an element in the head. That element will then be styled the same throughout the page.</li>
                <li> External CSS: The most common way to style a webpage. It is kept in a separate file which makes design changes easier.</li>
              </ul>
            <li> CSS starts with a what you’re wanting to style, called a selector. It is followed by the declaration statements in the declaration block. A declaration is made up of the property, such as color or size, and then the value, such as blue.</li>
            <li>DRY principle: DRY stands for “Do Not Repeat Yourself”. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, one can use commas to assign code to multiple elements.</li>
            <li>(More will be added once I can figure out how to show example code)</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            
          </ul>

          <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Github is used to help teams of developers work on the same project at the same time.</li>
            <li>Github lets people save iterations of their code so if something goes wrong people can revert back to previous versions without losing progress.</li>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>in git bash, commands relating to git start with git</li>
            <li>git add -A adds all commits on the currnet branch</li>
            <li>git commit -m "comment" lets you add a comment to the commit by writing the discriptive comment between the parentheses</li>
            <li>git pull origin branch-name makes sure the local brach is up to date.</li>
            <li>git push origin branch-name pushes the code to the remote repository</li>
            <li>Once the code is pushed to the remote repository, it creates a pull request, or PR.</li>
            <li>Ideally other peers and or team members will review the PR and make sure it works well. Once all parties agree the PR will be commited to the main code.</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Java Script was invented by Brendan Eich. </li>
            <li>JavaScript is dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any specific value type and any variable can be assigned values of all type.</li>
            <li>The set types in JavaScript language consists of primitive values and objects.</li>
            <li> Primitive values are data that are not an object and have no method or properties </li>
            <li>Examples of primitive values are:
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean type: Represents a logical entity and can have 2 values: “True” and “False”. </li>
                <li>Numbers type </li>
                <li>String type: Used to represent textual data.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Objects are a collection of properties.</li>
            <li>A key value is either a string value of a symbol value</li>
            <li>There are two types of data object properties: data property and accessor property</li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Conditional Statements and Loops can interrupt the control flow order.</li>
            <li>If statements are conditional logic.</li>
            <li>Something is considered ‘Falsy’ if it’s: 0, -0, undefined, NaN, or a boolean data type with a false value.</li>
            <li>Truthy is all other values</li>
            <li>If statements are conditional logic used in a block of code dependent on the variable. The computer will go done the list until the condition is met.</li>
              <ul>
                <li> For example: If our variable is x, we would say “if var is x then y action”. </li>
              </ul>
            <li> An If statement usually ends with else. </li>
            <li> An Array is a single variable that holds group data that is typically related. </li>
            <li> To recall a specific variable from an array we would use the index number. The index number is based on where the variable is in line. Starting with 0 and goes up by one.</li>
            <li>For loops are a type of loop that uses the predictable pattern of indices to preform a task with all items of an array by allowing a single code block repeatedly.</li>
            <li>A For loop contains three important statements: </li>
              <ul>
                <li>The first statement determines the starting point. To do so we declare a variable x and give it the value of 0. </li>
                <li>Next statement is the condition. For example length. Looking like: x < var length.</li>
                <li>The final statement allows the array to iterate over each time. For example: x+1”. </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>x++ can serve as a shortcut for writing x+1.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to preform a certain task.</li>
            <li>Unlike a For loop, a function must be specifically called to function. Kind of like a reference section of a book. </li>
            <li>The example used was making tea. One must write out the steps to make tea, but one doesn’t want to write it out every time they make a cup of tea. So a function serves to define the steps wanted, and can be called anytime by it’s name and the code will know what to run.</li>
          </ul>
